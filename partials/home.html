    <p><b>The Value of Money </b><br><br> The time value of money (TVM) is the concept that the money you have in your
        pocket today is worth more than the same amount would be if you received it in the future because of the profit
        it can earn during the interim. For example, let's say you can either receive a $100,000 payout today or $10,000
        per year for the next ten years totalling $100,000. Ignoring taxes, the $100,000 payout today is worth more,
        according to the TVM principle, because you can put your money to work. <br><br>Source : <a

    <p><b>GMO Food</b><br><br>Biotechnology is providing us with a wide range of options for how we can use agricultural
        and commercial forestry lands. The cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops on millions of hectares of
        lands and their injection into our food chain is a huge global genetic experiment involving all living beings.
        Considering the fast pace of new advances in production of genetically modified crops, consumers, farmers and
        policymakers worldwide are challenged to reach a consensus on a clear vision for the future of world food
        supply. <br><br>Source : <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3558185/">Read more >> </a> </p>

    <p><b>The View of World in 2100 </b><br><br> Drones are also playing an important role in the visualization of
        future buildings. Through drone-assisted 3D modelling, architects can create more realistic and immersive
        representations of their designs. These models can be used to conduct virtual tours, allowing clients,
        investors, and other stakeholders to get a better sense of what the completed building will look like from
        various perspectives. This is a far cry from the static renderings of the past, offering a dynamic view of the
        building within its actual environment. <br><br>Source : <a
